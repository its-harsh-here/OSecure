#Gautam:

135 | Microsoft EPMAP | TCP,UDP | Vulnerable(RPC DCOM vulnerability):
-	Facilitates communication between Windows systems for various services, including DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) and EPMAP (End Point Mapper)
-	If left open and insecure it is open to vulnerabilities like  "RPC DCOM"  which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems
-	We can close tis port using a firewall (windows:go to command prompt then select “block the connection” under Action after specifying the port)

137 | NetBIOS-ns | TCP, UDP | Vulnerbale:
-	It is primarily used for NetBIOS Name Service. It allows computers to communicate with each other using names instead of IP addresses
-	If left vulnerable NBNS traffic can be intercepted and analyzed by attackers, potentially revealing details about the network structure, connected devices, and shared resources.
-	We can close this port by using iptables(in linux)or using ufw (in ubuntu).In windows we can close it using a firewall

139 | NetBIOS-ssn | TCP, UDP | Vulnerable:
-	It is used for communication between computers using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. SMB enables users to access files, printers, and other shared resources on a network.
-	If left open attackers can exploit Port 139 to gain access to sensitive data(unauthorized access) stored on the server(information leakage).Another risk is the propagation of malwre through infected files.It can also be targeted with DOS and MITM attacks
-	To close this port we use windows defender firewall(only in windows),iptables for linux(sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 139 -j DROP) and UFW in ubuntu/Debian

143 | IMAP4 | TCP, UDP | Vulnerable:
-	IMAP is a email retrieval protocol that operates on port 143.It allows email clients to access and manage email messages stored on a remote server without the need to download them locally This enables users to access their emails from multiple devices 
-	If left open hackers on the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi) can intercept emails and passwords using tools like tcpdump.They can also take over email accounts if they get IMAP login credentials.Other attcks also include DOS and RCE.
-	To close in windows we can use windows firewall.For linux we can use iptables(sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 143 -j DROP)

Port 5900 | RFB/VNC Server | TCP, UDP | Vulnerable :
- This port  is necessary for VNC functionality, enabling remote control of a computer's desktop environment.
- If left open without proper security measures it poses significant risks such as Remote Access, Brute Force Attacks, Unencrypted Traffic and Exploiting Weak Configurations
- Close the port through a firewall(Linux : use iptables or ufw to block incoming traffic, Windows : block port 5900 through the Windows Firewall), disable the VNC service if it’s unnecessary, or enhance security by using encryption or tunneling. Always ensure that VNC access is protected by a strong password and ideally restricted to trusted IP addresses.

Port 6665-6669 | IRC | TCP | Not Inherently Vulnerable :
- They are commonly used by IRC services
- Targeted for attacks such as flooding, DDoS, and botnet control. 
- Consider closing these ports if IRC isn't needed or securing access by using firewalls, authentication, and encryption methods (like SSL/TLS).

 Port 6881 | BitTorrent | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- Typically used for BitTorrent file sharing
- While the protocol itself isn't dangerous, an open port can expose your system to various risks like malware, bandwidth consumption, and unauthorized access attempts.
- Close the port via a firewall, change the port in your BitTorrent client, or consider using a VPN for privacy and security. If you don’t need to use BitTorrent, the best solution would be to simply close or block the port entirely.

Port 6999 | BitTorrent | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- Port 6999 does not have an established or default use like other ports. However, it's sometimes used by peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing applications, by specific applications or services, and some developers may choose this port for custom software or protocols.
- Vulnerabilities : Exposure to Custom Applications, Exposure to Custom Applications, Network Exposure.
- If not need, it’s best to close it using a firewall. If it’s essential, ensure the application is updated, monitor network traffic, and restrict access to only trusted sources.

Port 6970 | QuickTime | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- used by custom or proprietary applications. Supports various types of network communications like remote management, file transfers, or specific network protocols, depending on the system or application.
- vulnerabilities: Exploitation of unpatched services, Denial-of-service attacks, Unauthorized access.
- to close this port block the port using a firewall, disable the associated service, or restrict access through network segmentation.

Port 8086 | Kaspersky AV | TCP | Vulnerable :
- typically used for web-based services like InfluxDB or custom HTTP services.
- Vulnerability : unauthorized access, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities, and DoS attacks.
- To close the port block the port using firewalls, restrict access through proper authentication and encryption, or change the port the service uses.

Port 8087 | Kaspersky AV | UDP | Vulnerable :
- Used for Web-based applications, Alternate HTTP/HTTPS services, and some specific services.
- Vulnerabilities : Unauthorized Access, Exploiting service vulnerabilities, Denial-of-service (DoS).
- to close this port block the port with a firewall, disable the associated service, or restrict access to the port through network segmentation or IP whitelisting.

Port 8222 | VMware Server | TCP, UDP | Vulnerable :
- used by the ActiveMQ broker for communication between clients and servers, particularly for web console or management interfaces.
- Vulnerabilities : Unauthorized Access to management interfaces, Exploiting service vulnerabilities, Denial-of-service (DoS).
- To close this port block the port using a firewall, disable or reconfigure the service, limit access to trusted users, and encrypt traffic where necessary.

Port 9100 | PDL | TCP | Vulnerable :
- used for RAW printing protocol, HP JetDirect, other printers or print servers.
- Vulnerabilities : Unauthorized printing, Data interception, Access to administrative functions, Denial-of-service (DoS).
- block the port via a firewall, disable or reconfigure printing services, limit network access to trusted devices, and use more secure printing protocols where possible (like IPP over HTTPS (port 443) or LPD (Line Printer Daemon)).

Port 10000 | BackupExec | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- typically associated with the Webmin service and virtualmin. It's often used for system administration tasks such as managing user accounts, configuring web servers, and managing other server settings.
- Vulnerabilities : Unauthorized access, Exploiting vulnerabilities in Webmin, Brute-force attacks, Denial-of-service (DoS).
- to close this port block the port using a firewall, secure Webmin with strong authentication and encryption, limit access to trusted users, or disable the service entirely if not needed.

Port 12345 | NetBus | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- Port 12345 has historically been used by NetBus, a well-known trojan. The trojan allows a remote attacker to gain control over an infected system, steal data, or perform other malicious activities. Besides NetBus, some legitimate services or applications could use port 12345, but the trojan’s notoriety makes this port a high-risk one to have open.
- Vulnerabilities : unauthorized access, data theft, and further network infiltration.
- To secure your system, block the port using a firewall, run a full malware scan, and ensure any software using the port is legitimate and up-to-date.

Port 27374 | Sub7 | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- Port 27374 is typically used by the Sub 7 trojan. This trojan allows an attacker to Control a victim’s system, Monitor activity, Access files and devices.
- Vulnerabilities : Remote Control by attackers, Data Theft and privacy violations, System instability and further compromise of the system or network.
- To mitigate these risks, block the port with a firewall, run a thorough malware scan, remove any detected trojans, and ensure your system is updated and secure, close the port on the router.

Port 31337 | Back Orifice | unofficial | Vulnerable :
- typically used by the Back Orifice trojan, which provides an attacker with remote access and control over an infected system.
- Vulnerabilities : Remote Control by attackers, Data Theft and privacy violations, Monitoring and spying, Denial-of-service (DoS) and further infection.
- To close the port block the port with a firewall, run a malware scan to detect any trojans, and ensure that your software is up-to-date to prevent exploits, close the port on the router.
