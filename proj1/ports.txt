Port 5900 | RFB/VNC Server | TCP, UDP | Vulnerable :
-This port  is necessary for VNC functionality, enabling remote control of a computer's desktop environment.
-If left open without proper security measures it poses significant risks such as Remote Access, Brute Force Attacks, Unencrypted Traffic and Exploiting Weak Configurations
-Close the port through a firewall(Linux : use iptables or ufw to block incoming traffic, Windows : block port 5900 through the Windows Firewall), disable the VNC service if itâ€™s unnecessary, or enhance security by using encryption or tunneling. Always ensure that VNC access is protected by a strong password and ideally restricted to trusted IP addresses.
