Summary: This code checks scans the list of ports in "ports.txt" and returns the ports which are open. 
An input of user's IP address by running the following command in your terminal: ./main <IP Address>

Code was written and tested on: 
- Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS                              
- Kernel: Linux 6.8.0-49-generic
- Architecture: x86-64

Tools Used: 
- Nmap
- Terminal(gcc)

Future Add-ons:
1. Write a menu driven code which gives the user a choice to get a list of the open port with a certain vulnerable rating(out of 5). 
2. Only print out open ports when executed for the first time.
3. Write another menu driven code to fetch data for each port number entered(from port.txt). Give description about the port; why is it vulnerable and how to close it!
