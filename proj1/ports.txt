List of ports checked by our code:

<Start writing here>

Port 5900 | RFB/VNC Server | TCP, UDP | Vulnerable :
- This port  is necessary for VNC functionality, enabling remote control of a computer's desktop environment.
- If left open without proper security measures it poses significant risks such as Remote Access, Brute Force Attacks, Unencrypted Traffic and Exploiting Weak Configurations
- Close the port through a firewall(Linux : use iptables or ufw to block incoming traffic, Windows : block port 5900 through the Windows Firewall), disable the VNC service if it’s unnecessary, or enhance security by using encryption or tunneling. Always ensure that VNC access is protected by a strong password and ideally restricted to trusted IP addresses.

Port 6665-6669 | IRC | TCP | Not Inherently Vulnerable :
- They are commonly used by IRC services
- Targeted for attacks such as flooding, DDoS, and botnet control. 
- Consider closing these ports if IRC isn't needed or securing access by using firewalls, authentication, and encryption methods (like SSL/TLS).

 Port 6881 | BitTorrent | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- Typically used for BitTorrent file sharing
- While the protocol itself isn't dangerous, an open port can expose your system to various risks like malware, bandwidth consumption, and unauthorized access attempts.
- Close the port via a firewall, change the port in your BitTorrent client, or consider using a VPN for privacy and security. If you don’t need to use BitTorrent, the best solution would be to simply close or block the port entirely.

Port 6999 | BitTorrent | Unofficial | Vulnerable :
- Port 6999 does not have an established or default use like other ports. However, it's sometimes used by peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing applications, by specific applications or services, and some developers may choose this port for custom software or protocols.
- Vulnerabilities : Exposure to Custom Applications, Exposure to Custom Applications, Network Exposure.
- If not need, it’s best to close it using a firewall. If it’s essential, ensure the application is updated, monitor network traffic, and restrict access to only trusted sources.
